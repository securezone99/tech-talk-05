## AI Chat Backend App 

# 1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. These include FastAPI, Uvicorn, and any other libraries required by the app. You can install these dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.

# 2. Set the environment variables required by the app. You can do this by creating a .env file and defining the necessary variables in it.

# 3. Run the app using the uvicorn command. cd ai-chat-backend and run running uvicorn main:ai_chat_backend --reload in your terminal. This will start the app and enable live reloading, so that the app will automatically restart whenever you make changes to the code.

# 4. Open a web browser and go to the URL where the app is running. You should see the app's homepage or a page with documentation for the app's API endpoints.

# 5. You can use the API endpoints by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate URLs. You can use a tool such as Postman to make these requests.
